"This is my first Git Repository."
On last Saturday, I attended the wonderful session on how to make professional profile on Linkedin and basics about Git & Github. The session was organised by Alpha Intern team and I got a lot of information on the same topics.
Thanks to Alpha intern and excited for coming sessions.....:)
